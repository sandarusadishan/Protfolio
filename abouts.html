        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Sandaru Sadishan, a final-year BSc (Hons) Computer Science
          (Software Engineering) student at Kingston University London. This
          marks a pivotal point in my academic journey as I strive to become a
          skilled and innovative software engineer. My technical skills span a
          variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, PHP,
          C, HTML, CSS, Angular, Spring Boot, and the MERN stack (MongoDB,
          Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I am also proficient in mobile
          application development using Java and Kotlin, and have hands-on
          experience working with MySQL and Firebase for database management and
          cloud services. Additionally, I am familiar with development tools
          such as IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, VS Code, Android Studio, and Excel.
          As part of my continuous professional development, I am currently
          deepening my knowledge in cloud architecture with AWS, having
          completed the AWS Fundamentals course. My journey so far has equipped
          me with the skills and expertise necessary to tackle complex
          challenges, and I am excited to continue refining my capabilities and
          contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of technology.
